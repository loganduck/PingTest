# Ping Network Test

When Start is clicked,  `ping -c 100 google.com` is executed in Terminal.

Ping is used to test connectivity on an IP network.

I/O redirections did not produce the expected output, so items are scanned over and written and saved to a file on the Desktop.

The purpose of this tool is to check internet connectivity.
